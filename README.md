# Torture the Hanging Man:3

![TtHM](https://github.com/GrassPerry/CompGame2/blob/main/images/tthm.png?raw=true)
A dark twist on the classic game hang man. Instead of the normal guilt of letting a man die each time you don't get a letter, you now have the disapointment that with each letter you don't get the man begins to escape your well planned out traps. There are different difficulty levels(easy, medium, hard) with new torture methods and words each level. With bloody but simple graphics and fun music(occasionally interuppted by screams) this game could be your new favorite version of hang man. So come on and play, and help us torture that hanging man.
